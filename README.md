# SpatioGPT

**SpatioGPT** is one of the earliest applications ever built around **ChatGPT**, created during the early days of OpenAI’s conversational models.  
Originally developed in **Flutter**, it served as a proof of concept for building an interactive AI assistant — before ChatGPT was widely available or had advanced reasoning features.

---

## Overview

SpatioGPT was designed to explore how conversational AI could extend beyond simple text replies.  
It combines **natural language understanding**, **reasoning visualization**, and **external tool integration** into one early agent-style system.

Key innovations include:
- A **reasoning and thinking process display** that shows how the AI “thinks” before producing a final answer — implemented before OpenAI introduced similar capabilities  
- **WolframAlpha integration** for advanced mathematical reasoning, computations, and factual lookups  
- A **modular agent design**, allowing the system to analyze queries and decide whether to reason, calculate, or respond conversationally  

This made SpatioGPT one of the first real attempts at creating an **AI reasoning agent**, long before tools like function calling or reasoning modes existed.

## Features

- 🤖 **ChatGPT Integration** – connects to OpenAI’s API for general conversation  
- 💭 **Visible Thought Process** – shows the AI’s reasoning steps before final output  
- 🧮 **WolframAlpha Integration** – solves complex equations and computational problems  
- 🧩 **Early Agent Behavior** – dynamically decides how to handle different query types  
- 🎨 **Cross-Platform Flutter UI** – clean interface running on Android, iOS, web, and desktop  
- 💬 **Real-Time Conversation** – responsive chat and message formatting

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lundii1/SpatioGPT.git
cd SpatioGPT/Spatio
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

You can use any connected device or emulator.

## Requirements

- **Flutter SDK** (latest stable version)  
- **Dart SDK**  
- **OpenAI API key** (for ChatGPT integration)  
- **WolframAlpha App ID** (for advanced computation)  

---

## Purpose

SpatioGPT was created as an **early exploration** of what conversational AI could become —  
not just a chatbot, but a reasoning system capable of explaining its process and using external tools.

It serves as a historical and technical reference point for:
- Early **reasoning visualization** in AI interfaces (1 year before Deepseek did it)  
- Experiments in **tool-augmented AI behavior** (Interaction between OpenAI and Wolfram)
- Cross-platform **chat-based AI apps** using Flutter
